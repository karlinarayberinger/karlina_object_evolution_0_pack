<p>(According to karbytes, the term <strong>ontology</strong> is defined as &#8220;the branch of metaphysics concerned with existence&#8221; while the term <strong>epistemology</strong> is defined as &#8220;the branch of metaphysics concerned with knowledge&#8221; (and karbytes defines the term <strong>metaphysics</strong> as &#8220;philosophical discourse about that which is more fundamental than physics&#8221; (and karbytes defines the term <strong>physics</strong> as &#8220;the culmination of knowledge about reality which takes the form of empirical measurements and mathematical relationships between such quantities&#8221;))).</p>

<p>This is a summarization of some science facts karbytes recently reviewed which may or may not be true but which are nevertheless interesting to karbytes:</p>
<p><em>Gravity waves travel at the speed of light and specifically light which travels through a vacuum.</em></p>
<p><em>Gravity is an emergent property of two objects with mass coexisting inside of the same three-dimensional space continuum.</em></p>
<p><em>Gravity is caused by objects with mass causing space-time to curve around those objects (and the steepness of that curvature is a function of how much matter is packed into a finite region of space).</em></p>
<p><em>Light (or, more generally, electromagnetic waves) travels at some maximum constant speed through a vacuum and at slower speeds through some kinds of mediums.</em></p>
<p><em>The faster a particular frame of reference named A is traveling relative to some other frame of reference named B, the slower A&#8217;s subjective experience of time passing is compared to B&#8217;s subjective experience of time passing.</em></p>
<p><em>Frames of reference which travel at the speed of light and specifically light which travels through a vacuum allegedly experience zero passage of time even when apparently traversing some finite region of space within some finite amount of time as measured by some relatively stationary frame of reference.</em></p>
<p><em>Atoms which absorb incoming photons (and photons are particles of light which allegedly contain almost zero mass if not zero mass and are also described as localized &#8220;packets of energy&#8221;) release electrons.</em></p>
<p><em>Hypothetically no object can travel faster than the speed of light and specifically light which travels through a vacuum.</em></p>
<p><em>Higher frequency electromagnetic waves transmit more energy and have shorter wavelengths than lower frequency electromagnetic waves even if both electromagnetic wave types are traveling at the same speed.</em></p>
<p><em>A photon is apparently a ubiquitous field until that photon is detected by a sensor at some discrete and localized point in space-time.</em></p>
<p><em>If a photon contains zero mass and is some finite allocation of energy (and energy can be quantified in terms of units such as calories and joules) that photon could be an irreducible building block of all matter such as electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms, and molecules (and that seems to be logically congruent with the physics equation which defines some amount of energy as being equivalent to some amount of mass multiplied by c squared (and c is the speed of light traveling through a vacuum).</em></p>
<p><em>A laser light beam which is projected at a piece of cardboard which has two parallel slits cut through it which are both inside the laser beam will show wave interference patterns which appear as contrasting bands of light and dark bands which are parallel to the cardboard slits on the wall on the side of the cardboard which is opposite to the laser. If one of those two slits is open, then only one band of light will appear on the wall.</em></p>
