<p>It is hypothesized that the following two things are all that can ever exist: pure nothingness (i.e. pure consciousness) and phenomena (i.e. finite permutations of energy, matter, space, and time).</p>
<p>Pure consciousness is assumed to be a boundless, changeless, irreducible, and featureless substrate which simultaneously renders and experiences phenomena.</p>
<p>Phenomena are assumed to spontaneously arise as a consequence of being desired by the substrate referred to as pure consciousness (and only the phenomena which pure consciousness wants to experience is ever rendered and experienced by some allocation of pure consciousness).</p>
<p>(A noumenon is an entirely abstract representation of a particular phenomenon. Therefore, a noumenon takes up neither energy nor matter nor space nor time. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Numbers</a> and arithmetic operations are assumed to be noumena until some <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> renders those specific numbers or arithmetic operations as phenomena inside of that information processing agent&#8217;s physical architecture).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">If pure consciousness wants to experience all noumena as phenomena, then pure consciousness is always rendering and experiencing all imaginable phenomena simultaneously.</span></p>
<p>Not every noumenon is necessarily ever manifested as a phenomenon for some natural number of times. In other words, it is hypothetically possible that there exist noumena that have never been instantiated as their corresponding phenomena.</p>
