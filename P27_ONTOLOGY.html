<p><strong>ONTOLOGY</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The following paragraphs depict a conversation which karbytes is having with itself about the nature of existence. Such inquiry is an example of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ontology</a> (and ontology is a branch of philosophy pertaining to conceptualizations about fundamental properties of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> (which are hypothesized to exist) such as space, time. matter, energy, information, consciousness, logic, quantities, randomness, probability, change, and choice).</span></p>

<p>karbytes(time_0): &#8220;Why are things the way they are? In more precise terms, what causes me to experience exactly one particular sequence of phenomena (i.e. finite instances of qualia such as color, shape, quantity) as time elapses from the perspective of my personal frame of reference and not some other permutation of phenomena?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_1): &#8220;Is my personal frame of reference the only frame of reference which currently exists (in the present), which has existed (in the past), and which will exist (in the future)? In other words, is reality solipsistic or do multiple renderings of space-time continuums exist simultaneously (at least some of the time from the vantage of objective reality)?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_2): &#8220;According to the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse hypothesis</a>, every imaginable space-time continuum exists immutably from the vantage of objective reality. If that hypothesis is true, then my personal rendering of space-time (and of the phenomenal objects which appear and disappear inside of that space-time continuum in exactly one chronological order) is inevitable because it is one of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinitely</a> many space-time continuums which nature encompasses.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_3): &#8220;Replace the word &#8216;infinitely&#8217; in the previous paragraph with &#8216;limitlessly many&#8217; (due to the fact that it is arguably possible for nature to not encompass infinitely many objects at any particular <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instant</a>, but rather, only a nonnegative integer number of objects at any particular instant).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_4): &#8220;Is nature a multiverse which contains infinitely many space-time continuums simultaneously and immutably? If the answer to that question is yes, then nature is a static object (meaning that it cannot increase or decrease the number of space-time continuums which it contains).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_5): &#8220;To answer the questions which karbytes(time_0) asks, I posit that a person experiences exactly what that person (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a>) subconsciously desires to experience (and the more a particular pattern of experiences is apparently chosen and, hence, rendered by the same information processing agent, the more likely that pattern is to be selected over all competing phenomenal patterns in that information processing agent&#8217;s future). Such <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/causality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causality</a> is referred to as <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-fulfilling prophecy</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_6): &#8220;To elaborate on what karbytes(time_5) claims, I posit that <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desire</a> is not necessarily what causes a particular sequence of events to occur such that the information processing agent which experiences that desire consequently observes that particular sequence of events to occurr. I would posit instead that desire is merely a phenomenon which sufficiently complex information processing agents experience and which correlates with events but which is not necessarily the cause of those events (though, in some cases, an information processing agent apparently has some degree of influence over which events occur as a result of formulating a preference for some kind of condition (i.e. goal state) which does not yet exist according that that information processing agent before that information processing agent interacts with its environment such that energy is transferred across space and time from one piece of matter to some other piece of matter and, consequently, the information processing agent observes the appearance of that goal state).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_7): &#8220;A computer program which takes a nonnegative integer smaller than or equal to 100 as input and then outputs that input value multiplied by itself three times is an example of how <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logic</a> can be used to control (relatively) physical events within the electronic computer which runs that program. A user of that program may assume that inputting the value 2 into that program will always output the value 8 (which is 2 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 2). That is because, in <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mathematics</a>, the function <strong style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00">y = f(x) := (x * x * x)</strong> assigns each input value, x, to exactly one logically corresponding output value, y.&#8221;</p>
