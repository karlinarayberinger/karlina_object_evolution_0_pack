<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The following paragraphs depict a conversation which karbytes is having with itself about the nature of existence. Such inquiry is an example of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ontology</a> (and ontology is a branch of philosophy pertaining to conceptualizations about fundamental properties of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> (which are hypothesized to exist) such as space, time, matter, energy, information, consciousness, logic, arithmetic, quantities, randomness, probability, change, and constancy).</span></p>
<hr>
<p>karbytes(time_0): &#8220;What causes me to experience exactly one particular sequence of phenomena (i.e. finite instances of qualia such as color, shape, quantity) as <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> elapses (from the perspective of my personal frame of reference) and not some other permutation of phenomena?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_1): &#8220;Is my personal frame of reference the only frame of reference which currently exists (in the present)? Is my personal frame of reference the only frame of reference which has ever existed (in the past)? Is my personal frame of reference the only frame of reference which will ever exist (in the future)? If the answer to each of the three questions which karbytes(time_1) asks is &#8216;yes&#8217;, then reality is solipsistic (which means that only one space-time continuum exists throughout all of nature and that only one chronological sequence of phenomena exists throughout all of nature (and that only one frame of reference exists which renders any and all phenomena throughout all of nature)).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_2): &#8220;I posit that every imaginable space-time continuum exists simultaneously and immutably inside of an all-encompassing set which I refer to as the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse</a>. If what I posit is true, then my personal rendering of space-time (and of the phenomenal objects which appear and disappear inside of that space-time continuum in exactly one chronological order) is inevitable because that space-time continuum (and the sequence of phenomena it contains) is one of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinitely</a> many space-time continuums which nature encompasses.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_3): &#8220;Replace the word &#8216;infinitely many&#8217; in the previous paragraph with &#8216;limitlessly many&#8217; (due to the fact that it is arguably possible for nature to not encompass infinitely many objects at any particular <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instant</a>, but rather, only a nonnegative integer number of objects at any particular instant).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_4): &#8220;Is nature a multiverse which contains infinitely many space-time continuums simultaneously and immutably? If the answer to that question is yes, then nature is a static object (meaning that it cannot increase nor decrease the number of space-time continuums which it contains).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_5): &#8220;To answer the questions which karbytes(time_0) asks, I posit that a person experiences exactly what that person (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a>) subconsciously desires to experience (and the more frequently a particular pattern of experiences is apparently chosen and, hence, rendered by the same information processing agent, the more likely that pattern is to be selected over all competing phenomenal patterns in that information processing agent&#8217;s future experiences). Such <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/causality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causality</a> is referred to as <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-fulfilling prophecy</a> or, perhaps in more general and objective terms, <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survival of the stable</a>. Such a heuristic of selection could be why some genetic traits are passed on for many generations in a species of organism while other genetic traits are transmitted across a smaller number of generations in that species of organism (and the genetic traits which are preserved for a larger number of consecutive generations are presumed to be the traits which enabled the carriers of those traits to survive better than the organisms of that species which lack those traits). Perhaps the most fundamental goal of any data structure is self preservation. <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memes</a> and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genes</a> are relatively simple data structures while information processing agents which store and transmit genes and memes are relatively complex data structures (given that I believe that all of physical reality is fundamentally comprised of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information</a> (and that I believe that information is fundamentally composed of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a> arranged in a particular pattern (and I believe that information is fundamentally either the detection of some arbitrarily small natural number of subatomic particles (especially <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photons</a>) making contact with a sensor (i.e. which can be abstractly represented as the registering of an “ON” signal (which is symbolically represented as the binary digit one (i.e. <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00">1</strong>))) or else the detected absence of some arbitrarily small natural number of subatomic particles (especially photons) making contact with a sensor (i.e. which can be abstractly represented as the registering of an “OFF” signal (which is symbolically represented as the binary digit zero (i.e. <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00">0</strong>)))))). For instance, the sequence of binary digits <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00">101</strong> can be used to store and transmit the <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/base_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base-ten</a> integer value seven (i.e. <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00">7</strong>) in the form of electromagnetic signals within the circuitry of an electronic computer (if that sequence of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/bits_and_bytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binary digits</a> is interpreted as being a base-two integer by that computer).”</p>
<p>karbytes(time_6): &#8220;To elaborate on what karbytes(time_5) claims about self-fulfilling prophecy, I posit that <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desire</a> is not necessarily what causes a particular sequence of events to occur such that the information processing agent which experiences that desire consequently observes that particular sequence of events to occur. I would posit instead that desire is merely a phenomenon which sufficiently complex information processing agents experience and which correlates with events but which is not necessarily the cause of those events (though, in some cases, an information processing agent apparently has some degree of influence over which events occur as a result of formulating a preference for some kind of condition (i.e. goal state) which does not yet exist according that that information processing agent before that information processing agent interacts with its environment such that energy is transferred across space and time from one piece of matter to some other piece of matter via an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">algorithmic</a> process and, consequently, the information processing agent eventually observes the appearance of that goal state).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes(time_7): &#8220;A computer program which takes a nonnegative integer smaller than or equal to 100 as input and then outputs that input value multiplied by itself three times is an example of how <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logic</a> can be used to control (relatively) physical events within the electronic computer which runs that program. A user of that program may assume that inputting the value 2 into that program will always output the value 8 (which is 2 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 2). That is because, in <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mathematics</a>, the function <strong style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00">y = f(x) := (x * x * x)</strong> assigns each input value, x, to exactly one logically corresponding output value, y. (The previous statements which karbytes(time_7) expresses is intended to imply that not all events are necessarily <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">random</a> and that, instead, some kind of logical or arithmetic rules constrain the behavior of matter and energy in relatively and extremely predictable ways).&#8221;</p>
