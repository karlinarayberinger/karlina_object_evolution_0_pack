<p><strong>PANPSYCHISM</strong>: The beholder of this ideology assumes that <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> is entirely contained inside of exactly one irreducible, immutable, and boundless substrate which is fundamentally conscious (i.e. self-aware) and which is inherently devoid of any phenomenal attributes (though phenomena may spontaneously appear or spontaneously disappear inside of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spatially and temporally</a> finite regions of that ubiquitous and featureless substrate).</p>
<p><strong>HIERARCHICAL_INTELLIGENCE</strong>: The beholder of this ideology assumes that all structures composed of matter are intelligent to some degree and that, the more complex a piece of matter is, the more that piece of matter possesses agency (i.e. the capacity to perceive itself as being situated inside of some kind of environment and, as a result, the capacity to interact with that environment in a goal-oriented manner (with the most fundamental goal being the preservation of that piece of matter&#8217;s structural integrity as time elapses according to that piece of matter)).</p>
<p><strong>SOLID_STATE_MULTIVERSE</strong>: The beholder of this ideology assumes that all imaginable space-time continuums (and the particular chronological sequence of phenomena which appear and which disappear inside of each particular space-time continuum) exist immutably and simultaneously.</p>
<p><em>As a corollary to the previous paragraph, the beholder of this ideology assumes that universal consciousness can arbitrarily &#8220;zoom into&#8221; any part of any space-time continuum by assuming the role of some spatially finite information processing agent which renders exactly one static frame of reference per timeless instant for any natural number of instances such that the localized consciousness appears to be inhabiting a space-time continuum with some temporal starting point.</em></p>
<p><strong>LIMITLESS_REINCARNATION</strong>: The beholder of this ideology assumes that the mind of an information processing agent may relive the same space-time continuum segment for any natural number of times as a &#8220;loop&#8221; or, at any point while traversing any space-time continuum segment, break out of that segment to enter a different space-time continuum (or else dissolve such that the mind of that information processing agent ceases to exist and, also, such that the lifespan of that mind reaches a temporal endpoint).</p>
