Instructions to karbytes: Write a command line C++ application which takes a real number as an input base and a real number as an input exponent and which returns the value of that base multiplied by base for exponent number of times. In other words, write a C++ program which computes a real number base to the power of a real number exponent (where base is a floating-point number value within a specific range which includes negative and positive real numbers and where exponent is a floating-point number value within a specific range which includes negative and positive real numbers). Each input value could be an integer or else a fractional number.
