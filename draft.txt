It seems like there are people in Castro Valley who think I should be prevented from studying and from using the Internet at my house. That's why I have been camping in the woods and using my laptop with mobile phone USB tethering for Internet access (and portable charging stations) in my tent. I don't understand why people are so opposed to me living my life. I think such people may be bored and want to entertain themselves by constantly picking fights with me. Perhaps those people think that I need to be prevented from enjoying my solitary hobbies because those people are jealous of me and want me to be deprived of alone time. It could also be that there are a lot of right wingers in Castro Valley near where I live who are very uncomfortable with intellectuals in their midst.
