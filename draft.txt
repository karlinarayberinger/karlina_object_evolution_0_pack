Instructions to karbytes: Write a command line C++ application which (a) prompts the user to input a real number value within a specific range of real number values which includes positive and negative values to store in a floating-point number variable named base, (b) prompts the user to input a real number value within a specific range of real number values which includes positive and negative values to store in a floating-point number variable named exponent, (c) computes the value of base multiplied by base for exponent number of times without using any C++ library functions such as pow(base,exponent) to perform that power calculation, and (d) displays the result (i.e. base to the power of exponent) to some arbitrary number of digits of precision as command line output.
