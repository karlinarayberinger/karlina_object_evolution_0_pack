If the entire physical universe (which encompasses the experience which you (i.e. some frame of reference) are currently having of you interacting with this website) is fundamentally comprised of some finite amount of digital information, then it is possible to create an identical copy of that universe (including the experience which you are having right now as you (a sufficiently intelligent information processing agent) interact with this website (which appears from your vantage to be external to your body and part of your encompassing environment)) inside of a computer which is external to your encompassing physical universe. (If such a simulation of your encompassing physical universe were running on some computer which is located inside of the same physical universe which that simulation is attempting to verbatim replicate virtually, that simulation would also need to include the atoms, subatomic particles, and energy transfers occurring within that computer (which makes for an infinitely recursive computer process which never reaches a base case)).
