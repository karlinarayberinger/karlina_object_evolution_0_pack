<strong>Which web pages of this website are what karbytes considers to be relatively "high quality"? Which web pages of this website are what karbytes considers to be relatively "low quality"?</strong>

<hr>

The following <strong>prose</strong> web pages of this website (which were each published prior to the date which this web page was published) are considered by karbytes to be relatively "high quality" web pages: TRANSHUMANIST_PERSONHOOD, NUMBERS, NATURE, and PUBLIC_DOMAIN. 

All other prose web pages of this website (which were each published prior to the date this web page was published) are considered by karbytes to be relatively "low quality" web pages. 

karbytes considers each of the <strong>code</strong> web pages (e.g. FACTORIAL, SQUARE_ROOT_APPROXIMATION, and PI_APPROXIMATION) of this website (which were each published prior to the date which this web page was published and which will be published after that date) to be relatively "high quality" web pages.

Web pages of this website which karbytes categorized as being <strong>relatively "high quality"</strong> are what karbytes considers to be essential components of this website. 

Web pages of this website which karbytes categorized as being <strong>relatively "low quality"</strong> are what karbytes considers to be non-essential (yet sufficiently relevant supplemental components) of this website.

According to karbytes, <strong>essential components</strong> of this website exhibit minimal ambiguity, minimal redundancy, and maximal relevance to karbytes' interests (and karbytes' interests can be summarized as metaphysics, physics, computer science, mathematics, logic, and digital media).

According to karbytes, <strong>non-essential (yet sufficiently relevant supplemental components)</strong> of this website are useful for addressing some of karbytes' imaginary critics but have little use otherwise.

<em>What karbytes hopes to accomplish in the future is publishing web pages on this website which are only what karbytes would honestly consider to be essential components of this website.</em>

<hr>

<strong>What are karbytes' goals pertaining to this website's future maintainance and development? What are karbytes' goals pertaining to karbytes' future survival and evolution as an person?</strong>

<hr>

karbytes intends to continue adding essential component web pages to this website until karbytes decides that this website is complete enough to not make any additional alterations to.

(It should be noted that karbytes might not ever reach a point in time in which karbytes considers this website to be complete enough to not make any additional alterations to).

karbytes intends for its personhood to survive for as long as possible.

For as long as karbytes is alive and has sufficient agency, karbytes intends to continue developing this website until karbytes decides that this website is complete enough to not make any additional alterations to.

For as long as karbytes is alive and has sufficient agency, karbytes intends to routinely back up each web page of this website to the WayBack Machine.

For as long as karbytes is alive and has sufficient agency, karbytes intends to continue working on projects which karbytes thinks are inspiring, worthwhile, and relevant to karbytes' interests (and karbytes' interests can be summarized as metaphysics, physics, computer science, mathematics, logic, and digital media).

<strong>What is karbytes' proposed response to being prevented from achieving its goals?</strong>

<hr>

karbytes has attempted to address challenges and hard limitations which karbytes might encounter when attempting to achieve its goals in the web pages of this website which karbytes considers to be non-essential (yet sufficiently relevant supplemental components).

karbytes intends to minimize its suffering by avoiding the pursuit of goals which karbytes thinks are not likely for karbytes' to ever achieve or which karbytes thinks would consume so much of karbytes finite resources that pursuing such goals would leave karbytes depleted of finite resources needed to accomplish more achievable goals.

At close to a bare minimum (and in the case that karbytes is unable to achieve the goals which karbytes enumerated in the previous section of this web page), karbytes hopes to find satisfaction in merely existing as a piece of nature (and, hopefully, as a conscious information processing agent capable of experiencing emotions such as gratitude, curiosity, and amusement in addition to posessing the ability to consciously carry out logical discources and the ability to imagine interesting or useful phenomena).

At a bare minimum (and in the case that karbytes is not able to find satisfaction in being a piece of nature (and possibly in the case that karbytes is not able to exist as a conscious information processing agent capable of experiencing emotions such as gratitude, curiosity, and amusement in addition to posessing the ability to consciously carry out logical discources and the ability to imagine interesting or useful phenomena)), karbytes will have at least accomplished as much as it currently has (and the culmination of karbytes' accomplishments are intended by karbytes to be represented by this website).

<em>At a bare minimum, karbytes has experienced a sense of accomplishment in developing and maintaining this website and in prolonging karbytes' survival and agency for as long as possible.</em>
