<p>It is hypothetically possible (but not necessarily guaranteed) for any imaginable universe to always exist somewhere within the multiverse.</p>
<p>Based on karbytes&#8217; current knowledge, each partial (rather than omniscient) frame of reference observes phenomena which each exclusively occur inside of exactly one finite region of space-time using a finite amount of energy.</p>
<p>Based on karbytes&#8217; current knowledge, each partial (rather than omniscient) frame of reference observes a subset of all imaginable phenomena (and that subset is assumed by karbytes to always be smaller than the set of all imaginable phenomena).</p>
<p>In older web pages of this website, karbytes suggested that deterministic events are constrained such that each information processing agent which experiences a partial (rather than omniscient) frame of reference observes only what that information processing agent most wants (subconsciously and consciously) to experience. In this relatively new web page of this website, karbytes would like to suggest an alternative hypothesis for why karbytes (which is an information processing agent which experiences a partial (rather than omniscient) frame of reference) has been observing one particular set of phenomena (in one particular chronological order) instead of some other set of phenomena or some other chronological order: something other than karbytes&#8217; (conscious and subconscious) preferences caused karbytes to experience the phenomena which karbytes&#8217; currently remembers experiencing.</p>
<p>Finally, although karbytes stated in older web pages of this website that karbytes prefers to maintain its continuity of consciousness (and public accessibility of the intellectual property which comprises this website) for a time period which always approaches infinity, in this relatively new web page of this website, karbytes would like to acknowledge that karbytes&#8217; now understands that karbytes might not get to maintain its continuity of consciousness (nor public accessibility of the intellectual property which comprises this website) for a time period which always approaches infinity. Rather than require that karbytes attain immortality of its own continuity of consciousness (as an information processing agent which experiences a partial (rather than omniscient) frame of reference) and immortality of karbytes&#8217; intellectual property in order for karbytes to feel satisfied, karbytes would like to change its satisfaction requirements such that karbytes strives to always derive as much satisfaction as possible from experiences which occur inside of finite space-time intervals according to karbytes&#8217; frame of reference.</p>
<p>As a corollary to the previous paragraph, karbytes would also like to mention that karbytes may continue to exist as an information processing agent experiencing its own uniquely corresponding partial frame of reference such that karbytes is not necessarily deriving what karbytes thinks is &#8220;minimally adequate satisfaction&#8221; from what karbytes experiences. (If karbytes thinks that karbytes is not likely going to experience enough of what karbytes defines to be &#8220;minimally adequate satisfaction&#8221; in karbytes&#8217; future, karbytes will probabably (but not necessarily) attempt to commit suicide).</p>
